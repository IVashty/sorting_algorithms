The big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm.

Data structure : Array

Time complexity ie best case,worst case and average case : O(n^2)

Total number of comparisons is given by :
(n -1) + (n-2) + (n+3) + .....+ 3 + 2 + 1 = n(n-1)/2  = O(n^2)

Totatl number of swaps is given by:
n(n - 1)/2 = O(n^2)

Best case time complexity : no swaps are made.

Average case time complexity : number odf swaps is n(n - 1)/4 = O(n^2)

Worst case time complexity :
